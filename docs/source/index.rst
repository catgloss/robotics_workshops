==================================

This repo provides:

* A reference implementation to implement an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
  service. This implementation uses simple open source components, and is deployable
  using docker.
* A tutorial to train and run inference of Wav2Veq-U, an unsupervised speech recognition model.
